# Introduction

React is a JavaScript library for building composable user interfaces. React uses only one HTML file called `index.html` to load the entire application. That is why it's called a single page application.

# JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is used to describe the UI using React. It creates React elements.


```tsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```
